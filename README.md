# change_counter

This repository was created to hold the code for an app and a webpage that counts the change you enter. Both are written in java and share similar code. Both have a calculate and rest button that clears ALL values. Both tell you:
- what you just entered in pennies, nickles, dimes, and quarters (dollar amount)
- the total amount you have in pennies, nickles, dimes, and quarters (dollar amount)
- how many pennies, nickles, dimes, and quarters you have (not the dollar amount, just the quantity)
- how many sleeves you will need for each coin amount based off its quantity
- the combine total of your pennies, nickles, dimes, and quaters

The only addition I see myselft making to both the app and webpage would be to add another button. The purpose of this button would be to subtract the sleeves and/or the coin amount(in quantity form NOT dollar form) to what you currently have for each coin.
